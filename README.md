CubeX-Open-Source-Firmware
==========================

This repo contains firmwares that I have customized for converting CubeX printers to use open source rambo boards.  They are designed for using a single extruder but could easily be modified for multiple extruders.  I do not own a cubeX printer so this will not be updated regularly.
